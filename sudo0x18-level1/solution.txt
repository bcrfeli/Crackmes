The main function scans user input and calls a function called checkPass (00101149),
this function takes the input as a char *. It declares a char on the 5th line and
checks if the first letter of our array is an 's': if (*param_1 == 's').
If it is, it continues, first, it sets the char variable declared on line 5 to the
element 1 of our array, then it moves into a big if statement that basically does the same thing
but with different letters at first sight, comparing, in total, 8 characters from our
array with characters stored in the variable.

(cVar1 = input[2], cVar1 == 'd'): this sets cVar1 to the second character in our
input and checks it against the character 'd' using a comma operator. It does this until the
solution: sudo0x18 is complete. If every condition in the if statement is true,
then we return 1, else we return 0. 
Going back to our main function, we check if the value returned by the checkPass
function is zero or not. If it isn't, we find the message: "You are correct :)".

thanks to sudo0x18 for this crackme!
